/**
 * Helsingin yliopisto -theme's markup is as follows:
 *
 *  <page>
 *    <top-bar></top-bar>
 *
 *    <menu-bar>
 *      <header>
 *        <branding></branding>
 *        <navigation></navigation>
 *      </header>
 *    </menu-bar>
 *
 *    <hero></hero>
 *
 *    <main>
 *      <content></content>
 *      <sidebar-first>
 *      <sidebar-second>
 *    </main>
 *
 *    <footer></footer>
 *  </page>
 * 
 * The visual presentation for the user however is very different with the 
 * menu-bar positioned to the right, just under the top-bar and all other 
 * content next to the menu-bar. The hero section takes 100% of the browsers 
 * width and is located under the menu-bar. Please refer to the preview image 
 * of the hy-layout for more detail.
 * 
 * The header-section and branding and navigation regions inside it are placed 
 * inside the menu-bar for crawlers to read the page information from correct 
 * place. They expect to find main navigation and branding information inside 
 * the header and since all this information is placed in the menu bar, the 
 * header wrapper should be located here as well.
